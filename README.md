# Persona3 Reload | Save Editor (Steam)
A tool to edit : Money, Firstname, Lastname (can don't work), Player current PC/PV
I could possibly add other functions (Persona, object, character location...)
(Firstanme and Lastname options is actually disable)

But I can't guarantee anything, as the game saves data (GVAS) in a way that's hard to understand
(for example, depending on the size of the firstname/lastname, it may be saved separately in 3 values,
as the game uses values as UInt32 for saving).
